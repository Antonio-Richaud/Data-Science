In this corner of the internet, I will gradually upload all the interesting works related to data science. This repository is a collection of my experiments, analyses, and projects using various data science techniques and tools.

## Description

In this repository, you will find various works related to data science. My goal is to explore and experiment with different data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools, share my findings, and learn in the process. Some of these works will be shown in my [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@antonio_richaud) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKB7A8ranhDjXVH3pQ5IUA) videos, where you can see in detail how they work and how I implement them.

## Repository Content

This repository contains:

- **Data Analysis:** Projects involving data analysis using tools like Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Implementations of ML algorithms, prediction models, and practical case studies.
- **Data Visualization:** Works related to creating graphs and interactive visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Projects focused on text analysis, natural language generation, etc.
- **Big Data:** Experiments and projects using big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark.

Additionally, I recommend checking out another data science repository I created during my Data Science Bootcamp, which contains a variety of projects and insights from my learning journey.

## How to Use This Repository

You can clone this repository to explore the projects and experiments yourself. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Antonio-Richaud/Data-Science.git
   ```
   
   
2. **Explore the projects:**
   Each folder contains a different project with its own README explaining how it works and how you can run it.

## Contributions
